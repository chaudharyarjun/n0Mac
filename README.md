# n0Mac
Yet Another Mac Changer!!!

This script changes the MAC address of the network interface to a randomly generated address on system startup using crontab. It then uses the macchanger command to generate a list of MAC address vendors and selects one at random and then combines that vendor prefix with a randomly generated suffix to create the new MAC address.
